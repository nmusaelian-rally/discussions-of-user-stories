## Overview
this is an example of a grid with ConvesationPosts. Two Rally.data.WsapiDataStores are created, one for HierarchicalRequirement object, the other for ConversationPost object since currently WsapiDataStore cannot have more than one model, and then a grid is built off a Rally.data.custom.Store
